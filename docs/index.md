# Re-Imagining Access

## Introduction

This page documents the process of installing and testing an audio transcription demonstration application based on the open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system called [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/), released on September 21, 2022 by OpenAI.  

Whisper is a deep neural network trained on a large (680,000 hours of recordings) and diverse dataset collected from the web.  It represents a new milestone in speech recognition with “improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language” among other advertised features.
